<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yared Kinetibeb. I am Ethiopian. I was born in 2003 and i'm 21. Now i have joined Addis Ababa Scinece and Technology University.
 And i'm a 3rd year Electrical and Computer Engineeing department student. Before i joind this technology campus i didn't have 
 any interest and knowledge about programing but after, i found that being a programer is an ultimate and the best occupation in this era.
 Knowing this i started to introduce myself to the digital world and that wasn't not that much difficult. And now thanks for my mentor Angela
 she is an amazing teacher and i have never had such kind of teacher she is such a magical kind of girl, so now with her i'm tring to upgrade my self.
